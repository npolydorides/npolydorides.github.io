        <h1>Computing with Randomness: Randomised Numerical Linear Algebra, Theory and Applications</h1>
          
        <h4 align="justify" >Randomised Linear Algebra (RandNLA) provides a framework for estimating the results of some fundamental matrix operations and decompositions in high-dimensions. The approach exploits randomness to approximate data intensive operations, by selecting small subsets of the data according to some optimal sampling distributions. RandNLA is underpinned by an elegant theory that sits at the interface of applied probability and linear algebra, dealing primarily with issues pertaining the design of optimal sampling distributions and the induced variance of the resulting estimators. We are looking into problems on clustering and sketching in large graphs and matrices, as well as randomised algebra methods for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations and inverse problems.</h4>
        
        <h2>Data Sketching & Clustering</h2>
        <h4 align="justify">RandNLA provides a framework for designing optimal sketching and clustering algorithms to process large, often streaming, datasets looking primarily for structure and online analytics. Our aim is to investigate randomised sampling schemes for low dimensional sketching and clustering and examine the quality of the approximations in terms of the relevant information measures, ease of implementation and speed of convergence. Owing to their capacity to explore low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional spaces, sketching and clustering find applications in dimensionality reduction and principle component analysis, where convensional linear algebra tools becomes combersome. </h4>
          
        <h2>Partial differential equations & Inverse problems</h2>
    
        <h4 align="justify"> RandNLA finds applications in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on graphs or finite element grids. In this context RandLA can be used to trace a low-dimensional model structure and approximate the solution of the PDE more efficiently. Our aim is to develop and analyse RandNLA-based methodologies in the context of RandLA for reducing the computational complexity of high-dimensional numerical model simulation and model parameter estimation. A key element of this approach is to exploit the properties of the underlying differential operators in order to design optimal sampling strategies for the model matrices and data involved. We will also seek to investigate the scope of RandLA in solving large-scale PDE-constrained inverse problems by randomly selecting and weighting appropriate subsets of the pertinent equations in a way that improves conditioning with respect to inversion with minimal loss of information.</h4>
