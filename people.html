          <li><h4><b>Nick Polydorides</b></h4></li> <h4 align="justify">Nick is a Senior Lecturer in Electrical Engineering working in computational modelling, imaging and data analytics. He did his PhD on tomographic inverse problems at the University of Manchester (2002) and have an MSc in Computing from the University of Oxford (1999), and a BEng in Electrical Engineering from UMIST (1998). Previously he held postodoctoral research positions at the University of Manchester (Mathematics) and MIT (Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) before appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Cyprus Instutute. At the University of Edinburgh he heads the Institute for Digital Communications. As of 2016, he is also a <a href="http://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Turing</a> fellow in Data Science.</h4>

          <li><h4><b>Dimitris Kamilis</b></h4></li> <h4 align="justify">Dimitris has a PhD degree from the University of Edinburgh with his thesis on "Uncertainty Quantification for low-frequency Maxwell equations with stochastic conductivity models". He also holds a physics degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, an M.Sc. in theoretical physics from Imperial College London and an M.Sc. in computational science & engineering from Umeå University, Sweden. His research interests include uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inverse problems, high-dimensional approximation of PDEs and model reduction.</h4>

          <li><h4><b>Yue Wu</b></h4></li> <h4 align="justify">Yue was a research fellow at TU Berlin within the research group 'Rough paths, stochastic differential equations and related topics'. She once held a lectureship in Financial Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. She received both of her MSc and PhD degrees from Loughborough University, with the PhD thesis addressing the existence problems of random periodic solutions to S(P)DEs. She obtained her BSc degree in Mathematics and applied Mathematics from Shandong University, China. Her broad research interests include numerical analysis, uncertainty quantification, stochastic analysis, financial mathematics, rough path theory and random dynamical systems, with current focus on inverse problems.</h4>

His undergraduate studies were focusing mostly on probability theory and statistics in a wide range of application areas. More recently he developed an interest in randomised Linear Algebra and high dimensional probability which formed the basis for his MSc research about matrix recovery under Poisson noise. His Ph.D. project is on sketching methods aimed at reducing acquisition times and improve image quality in X-ray computed tomography. </h4>
