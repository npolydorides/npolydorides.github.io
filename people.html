He has a PhD on image reconstruction for Electrical Impedance Tomography from the University of Manchester (2002), an MSc in Computing from the University of Oxford (1999), and a BEng in Electrical Engineering from UMIST (1998). Before his arrival in Edinburgh, he held postodoctoral research positions at the University of Manchester (Mathematics) and MIT (Lab for Information and Decision Ssytems) and was appointed assistant Professor at the Cyprus Instutute. At the University of Edinburgh he was the head of the Institute for Digital Communications (2017-2022), and during 2016-2020, he was a <a href="http://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Turing</a> fellow in Data Science.</h4>

          <li><h4><b>PDRA 1</b></h4></li> <h4 align="justify">Yue was a research fellow at TU Berlin within the research group 'Rough paths, stochastic differential equations and related topics'. She once held a lectureship in Financial Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. She received both of her MSc and PhD degrees from Loughborough University, with the PhD thesis addressing the existence problems of random periodic solutions to S(P)DEs. She obtained her BSc degree in Mathematics and applied Mathematics from Shandong University, China. Her broad research interests include numerical analysis, uncertainty quantification, stochastic analysis, financial mathematics, rough path theory and random dynamical systems, with current focus on inverse problems.</h4>

His undergraduate studies were focusing mostly on probability theory and statistics in a wide range of application areas. More recently he developed an interest in randomised Linear Algebra and high dimensional probability which formed the basis for his MSc research about matrix recovery under Poisson noise. His Ph.D. is on quantitative imaging of gases dispersed in the atmosphere using optical remote sensing measurements. </h4>
